# wave_python_program
# This program is a program that removes most of the vocal sound from songs.
# The processing time is more than twice the length of the song.
# The processed wave file will have almost the same key as the original song by setting the speed to 0.92x, transpose to -1, and tune to -20.
# Requires tqdm installation.
# We cannot be held responsible for any damage caused by using this program.
